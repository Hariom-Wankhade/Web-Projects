The website aims at collecting the information of the different institutes from all over the Maharashtra and displaying the information to the higher authorities (Director, Joint - director) at one platform.
The project contains everything about the institutes initializing from their land area to regional office, from student details to faculty details, from project reports to extra activities, also their NBA accredation status, approvals of hostel etc. If we decided to find these details by visiting the respective instituteâ€™s website it would take a lot of time and efforts.
Thus, this Institute Management System is being developed for such purpose only to maintain all the work power of an institute in a single database server. This model will also be able to solve the problem of time as well as reduce the paper work.
